The Major League Baseball season runs from the start of April to the end of September, 
with each club playing 162 games. This means that baseball players have about one day 
off every ten days, so baseball is pretty much "game-a-day". 
The season begins with the official Opening Day and runs 26½ weeks through the last 
Sunday of September or first Sunday of October. The MLB’s regular season consists of 162 games, 
all crunched into a 6-month timeframe.
